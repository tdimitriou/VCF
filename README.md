# VCF
Visual Component Framework

A COM based Framework built entirely in VB6 which supports MVVM and a subset of XAML.

* Bindings (including Command Bindings) are supported.
* Dependency Properties are supported, but partially implemented at the moment.
* The XAML resources are stored externally (as XML files) and loaded during component initialization.

The Framework is based on [VBRichClient](http://www.vbrichclient.com) (version 5)

*A sample project demonstrating the base functionality will be added soon.*
